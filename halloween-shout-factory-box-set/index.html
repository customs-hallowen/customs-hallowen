<p>Factory just unveiled the mother of all friday the 13th box sets, which is sure to be of interest to the serious horror and slasher geeks in the audience. Is the box set released by anchor bay or shout factory? So i have the shout halloween box set and i was wondering if there are any extra bonus features that are on the single shout releases that are not present in the box set? Only condition issues is on a few places on the box as you can see from the pictures. Wish someone would put out another halloween box set, some of those films have been out of print for years.</p>
