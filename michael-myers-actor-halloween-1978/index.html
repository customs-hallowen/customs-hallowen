<p>In 1978, during the making of the original halloween, the prop department was faced with the daunting task of finding a frightening mask that the villain could wear. Movies, tv, celebs, and more. Fifteen years later, he escapes and returns. I�ve always wondered why michael myers goes after laurie in the first movie (ignoring the whole �sister� scenario from the second movie).

<p>Anthony moran (born august 14, 1957) is an american actor and producer. With donald pleasence, jamie lee curtis, tony moran, nancy kyes. Though castle�s face was largely hidden behind michael myers� iconic mask, he was just as instrumental as jamie lee curtis to making john carpenter�s slasher movie into the horror classic it is today. As a young child in the beginning of the movie, michael is played by will sandin. He is the archenemy of laurie strode and sam loomis.</p>
