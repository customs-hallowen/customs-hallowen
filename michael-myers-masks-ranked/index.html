<p><strong>Michael Myers Masks Ranked</strong>. With scary masks but no michael myers, would it live up to what i had imagined from other pieces of pop culture? Michael myers is a fictional character from the halloween series of slasher films.he first appears in 1978 in john carpenter�s halloween as a young boy who murders his elder sister, judith myers.fifteen years later, he returns home to haddonfield to murder more teenagers. The only redeeming quality of this film, which reveals michael myers�s homicidal nature is the result of a celtic curse, is the mask. Michael awakens from a coma one year after the events of halloween 4, and a �shape� mask is hanging on a wall in the shack of a local hermit (supposedly the same one as h4, though the masks are clearly different).he acquires his mask and murders the hermit.</p>
