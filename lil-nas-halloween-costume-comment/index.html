Just a couple years into his career, the “old town road” artist has finally embraced his past as the head of a nicki minaj stan account. His costume appeared to be an exact replica of a pink cheetah print outfit that nicki wore in her video for “super bass” in 2011. The “power” producer took to twitter to send a message.
