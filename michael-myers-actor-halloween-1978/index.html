<p>In 1978, during the making of the original halloween, the prop department was faced with the daunting task of finding a frightening mask that the villain could wear. Movies, tv, celebs, and more. Fifteen years later, he escapes and returns. Iï¿½ve always wondered why michael myers goes after laurie in the first movie (ignoring the whole ï¿½sisterï¿½ scenario from the second movie). La historia empieza la noche de halloween de 1963 cuando michael myers, un niÃ±o de seis aÃ±os, vestido con un traje de payaso, sube al cuarto de su hermana mayor judith myers y se pone una mÃ¡scara de payaso que el novio de su hermana llevaba.</p>

<p>Anthony moran (born august 14, 1957) is an american actor and producer. With donald pleasence, jamie lee curtis, tony moran, nancy kyes. Though castleï¿½s face was largely hidden behind michael myersï¿½ iconic mask, he was just as instrumental as jamie lee curtis to making john carpenterï¿½s slasher movie into the horror classic it is today. As a young child in the beginning of the movie, michael is played by will sandin. He is the archenemy of laurie strode and sam loomis.</p>
